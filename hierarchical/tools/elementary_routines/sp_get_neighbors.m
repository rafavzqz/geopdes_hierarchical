% SP_GET_NEIGHBORS: Compute the indices of functions that share one element in the support of a given list of functions
%
% neighbors_indices = sp_get_neighbors (space, msh, indices)
%
% INPUT:
%    space:   object defining the space of discrete functions (see sp_bspline)
%    msh:     object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%    indices: indices of the functions.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    neighbors_indices: indices of the functions that interact with the given ones.
