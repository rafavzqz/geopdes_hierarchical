% SP_GET_BASIS_FUNCTIONS: Compute the indices of tensor-product B-splines acting on a list of cells.
%
% fun_indices = sp_get_basis_functions (space, msh, indices)
%
% INPUT:
%    space:   object defining the space of discrete functions (see sp_bspline)
%    msh:     object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%    indices: indices of the cells.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    fun_indices: indices of the basis functions acting on the cells.
