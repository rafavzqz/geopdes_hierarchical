- Add the references to articles (our preprint, THB-splines)

- Clean estimate and mark
- Change name of adaptivity_solve_laplace. Make it a script, instead of a function.
- Try to optimize the refinement, if possible 
- Try to avoid recomputing the 1D spaces for the boundary

- In the matrix hspace.C, save only the functions working on active elements
