- Fix the number of levels in hspace, to be as in hmsh. Change the way the operators use the number of levels (see op_f_v_hier)
- Clean refine
- Plot using hsp_eval
- Change name of adaptivity_solve_laplace. Make it a script, instead of a function.
- Make the classes, hierarchical_mesh and hiearchical_space. Move the functions into the classes.
- Implement the truncated basis.
- Change the way to call hsp_eval (also in geopdes_base).
